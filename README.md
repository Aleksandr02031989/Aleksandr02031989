## Hi I’m Aleksandr 👋
----------------
Manual Test Engineer
----------------
I am a software tester with a genuine passion for my work and a commitment to ensuring high-quality products. I possess knowledge in manual testing, including creating test cases, executing tests, and analyzing results. I have experience working with Agile and Scrum methodologies, as well as skills in using API testing tools such as Postman. I am adept at analyzing requirements, identifying bugs, and documenting test results. My experience in technical support and interacting with users has helped me develop strong communication skills and an understanding of customer needs, enabling me to work effectively both in teams and independently.

I am looking for a team where I can continue to develop as a Manual Test Engineer, share ideas, and help create quality products that improve users' lives. I strive to quickly master new tools and approaches in testing to effectively integrate into the team and contribute to achieving common goals.
